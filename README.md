## How it works

### gensub.py
Analyse the original subtitle of Kirara Fantasia story
  - Crop binarized frames, ROI of subtitle area and track change on that area
  - Detect change the TextArea and NameTag
  - Generate a timestamp file in &lt;videoname&gt;_autosub/timestamp.txt, containing timestamp of 
    - TextArea fade-in, fade-out
    - Newline of subtitle
    - Carriage return
    - Inline Pause
  - Capture the original subtitle (including name and text) as colored image
    - Store NameTag to &lt;videoname&gt;_autosub/img/nmtg_%04d.png
    - Store TextArea to &lt;videoname&gt;_autosub/img/text_%04d.png

### pretrans.py
Generate a empty subtitle file and web-based tool for editing subtitle
  - Analyse the same name of nmtg_%d.png, and bind them as the same string

As for the usage of webpage, refer to next section.

### applysub.py
Apply the translated subtitle to the original video, it depends on
  - the timestamp file generated by gensub.py
  - the subtitle file generated by the web-based editing tools
  - a truetype font file in usr/font.ttf

## How to do
### Dependence 
  - python
    - Pillow
    - numpy
    - opencv2
  - ffmpeg (if you want to generate with audio track)
### Usage
  - Record a Kirara Fantasia Story video, make sure the resolution is 750 x 1334 (I recorded by iPhone 6s, iOS11)
  - Copy the video to an empty folder
  - run the commands below, replace &lt;videoname&gt; by your actual video name
  > python gensub.py -i &lt;videoname&gt;
  
  > python pretrans.py -i &lt;videoname&gt;
  - open &lt;videoname&gt;_autosub/html_gen.html
  - edit the name and text in right two columns, for pink colored text, use a pair of $ to surround
  
  > Hmm, where would be a good place to start...\nKirara, you've read the $scriptures$, right?

  > Yes. \n$The goddess$ granted it to us, didn't she?
  
  > "The goddess" surrounded by a pair $ will be rendered in pink color

  - ensure these is a font file in 'usr/font.ttf'
  - run the commands below, replace &lt;videoname&gt; by your actual video name
  > python apply.py -i &lt;videoname&gt;
  
  - and you will get the output video as out.m4v
