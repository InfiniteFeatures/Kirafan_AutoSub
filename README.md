## How it works

### gensub.py
Analyse the original subtitle of Kirara Fantasia story
  - Crop binarized frames, ROI of subtitle area and track change on that area
  - Detect change the TextArea and NameTag
    - Analyse the same name of nmtg_%d.png, and bind them as the same string
  - Generate a timestamp of
    - TextArea fade-in, fade-out
    - Newline of subtitle
    - Carriage return
    - Inline Pause
  - Store information to autosub/videonam.krfss in json format
  - Capture the original subtitle (including name and text) as colored image
    - Store NameTag to autosub/videoname_img/nmtg_%04d.png
    - Store TextArea to autosub/videoname_img/text_%04d.png

### applysub.py
Apply the translated subtitle to the original video, it depends on
  - the timestamp file generated by gensub.py
  - the subtitle file generated edited by directly editing json file or using the web-based editing tools
  - a truetype font file in usr/font.ttf

  > Hmm, where would be a good place to start...\nKirara, you've read the $scriptures$, right?

  > Yes. \n$The goddess$ granted it to us, didn't she?
  
  > "The goddess" surrounded by a pair $ will be rendered in pink color
